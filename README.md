INTRODUCTION



This README file contains three files. A file which outputs students grades, another that demerit points from ovespeeding drivers and one that generates the net salary of employees

BODY


Required to:


1. Create a repository on your GitHub account. 

NB: All the solutions are held in one folder

2. The solutions have been written majorly using JavaScript and a bit of html for intializing the browser to prompt user inputs and give outputs

3. once done with the solutions ,they are to commit and push the work to github 

4. The repository link is then Submitted  for grading.



THE CHALLENGES

Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator 

 You are suposed to Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below: 

        A > 79, 
        B - 60 to 79, 
        C -  59 to 49,
        D - 40 to 49, 
        E - less 40.

 

Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)


Required to Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 70. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)

You are to Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary.

- THE LINKS ARE FROM EXTERNAL SITES

CONCLUSION

By solving the 3 challenges you are practising to implement javaScript to finding solutions to daily problems. using call back functions and alterating through functions.
