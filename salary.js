   This program outputs  to the user their tax deductions, nhif, nssf, the total amount deducted then prints out the  
    Gross salary = all_benefits + basic salary e.g house_allowance + hardship_allowance + risk_allowance + basic_salary
    Taxable income = Gross pay
    Deductions = (Tax + NHIF + NSSF)
    Earnable pay = Gross pay - deductions e.g Gross salary - (Tax + NHIF + NSSF) ==> net salary
    Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individualâ€™s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary. 

NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided//
